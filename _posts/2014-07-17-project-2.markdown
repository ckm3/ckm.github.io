description: We present a photometric, spectroscopic, asteroseismic, and evolutionary analysis of the Algol-type eclipsing binary KIC 12268220. The evolutionary tracks of our model suggest that the low-mass (~ 0.23 solar masses) evolved secondary shows a similar evolutionary state to the R CMa-type system, which might evolve to an EL CVn system.
