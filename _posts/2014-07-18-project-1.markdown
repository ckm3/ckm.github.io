description: We explore a systematic approach based on the light curve pre-processing, period detection and candidate selection. We also develop a simulated light curve test to quantify our detection limits for the SAP data. After applying our method to the raw SAP light curves, we found more than 1000 main-sequence stars with the period longer than 30 days, 165 are newly discovered.
