description: We develop a novel detection algorithm based on a well-proven object detection framework in the computer vision field. Through training the network on the light curves of the confirmed Kepler exoplanets, our model yields 94% precision and 95% recall for transits with signal-to-noise ratio higher than 6 (set the confidence threshold to 0.6). The code is available at <body> <a href="https://github.com/ckm3/Deep-Transit" style="color:red;">GitHub</a> </body>.
